3 algorithms used are 1)knn, 2)random forest, 3) ltsm deep learning

First thing I did was data manipulation
cleaned the data to replace 0 with nan values
split dataset to training set and testing set
then used pre existing libraries for knn, random forest and ltsm model to train the data and test on the rest of the data
DataSet: https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database?select=diabetes.csv
